<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Gameswipe is a responsive Single Page Application (SPA) designed to help users curate a virtual collection of their favorite games and those they have played. In addition to tracking your gaming history, Gameswipe fosters connections by enabling you to connect with friends and discover shared gaming interests.

### Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**
- **React**
- **Redux** for the State management
- **React Router** for the Navigation between pages
- **React Hook Form** for handling forms with validation
- **Scss** and **framer-motion** for the style and the animations

### Features

- **Eplore Games**: Users can explore a wide variety of games through an intuitive swipe-like interface, allowing them to filter by Console, Company, Genre, and Year of Production. This feature makes it easy to browse and discover new titles. Games can be added to your personal collection of played games, added to a wishlist for future consideration, or discarded if they don't fit your preferences.
- **Add Friends**: The Friends page enables users to connect with others by adding friends to their network. Once connected, you can explore a dedicated section that highlights games both you and your friends have enjoyed. Additionally, you can discover games that are unique to your friend's collectionâ€”either games they've played or ones they have shown interest in.
